The group decided to use "Practical Fibonacci" to estimate the work required for the following user stories:


Game Played Difficulty
- Set difficult level of easy, normal and hard: 3
https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/276-2022-7-Aluminium/CoopAchievement/-/issues/22
- When viewing an achievement screen, I want to see the difficulty level listed on the screen: 2
https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/276-2022-7-Aluminium/CoopAchievement/-/issues/23
- When viewing the list of games played, I want to see the difficulty level listed for each game play: 2

Achievement Improvements
- When achievement level is earned, display image, animation effect, and sound as celebration: 5

Edit Game Played
- When viewing a previous game play, I'd like to be able to edit it to correct any errors, 
such as changing scores or difficulty so that I can correct any errors from previous game plays. : 3

Score Calculator
- Create UI for Individual Scores: 5
https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/276-2022-7-Aluminium/CoopAchievement/-/issues/36
- The app should know the individual scores in the future, so that I can later go back and see or edit the individual scores: 5
